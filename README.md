# Data-Science-Analysis-for-Urban-Planning-and-Community-Investment-for-mock-Census-Data
This project involves analyzing a mock census dataset to make data-driven decisions for urban planning and community investment in a fictional town. The dataset, simulated using the Faker package, mirrors the format of the UKâ€™s 1881 census with modern demographics. After cleaning and preparing the data, key analyses were conducted to address two primary objectives:

Proposing a development plan for an unoccupied plot of land, with options including high-density or low-density housing, a train station, a religious building, an emergency medical center, or alternative infrastructure, based on population needs and trends.
Recommending an area of investment such as employment and training, old-age care, schooling, or general infrastructure, by examining population growth, unemployment trends, religious affiliations, marital status, household occupancy, commuter statistics, and birth and death rates.
The project incorporates statistical methods, hypothesis testing, and visualization to support decisions and balance competing community needs.
